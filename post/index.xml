      <description>&lt;p&gt;This computing technique makes direct use of distinctively quantum mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform the operation on the data. The basic and extraordinary idea for quantum computing is that in normal classical computers, bits are the basic smallest unit of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantum computers use qubits (Quantum bits) which can also be set up as 0 or 1 likewise the classical bits but the container of these bits are changed from transistors to photons. A Qubit can be among any 2 level quantum system, such as spin and a magnetic field, or a single photon. The possible states can be entitled as 0 or 1 as per the horizontal or vertical polarisation. Consequently, of Quantum World theory, qubit doesn‚Äôt have to be just one of those. it can be in any ratio of both the states at once. That merely called as Superposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This can lead to a severe and groundbreaking foundation in the field of computer science. This helps to solve many unsolved or virtually solvable problems with the unified space and time complexities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Facts to blow your mind ‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quantum computing requires extremely cold temperatures, as sub-atomic particles must be    as close as possible to a stationary state to be measured. The cores of D-Wave quantum     computers operate at -460 degrees f, or -273 degrees c, which is 0.02 degrees away from    absolute zero.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some researchers at IBM contest the ‚Äúsupremacy‚Äù claim, saying that a traditional           supercomputer could solve the problem in 2.5 days, not 10,000 years. Still, 200 seconds    is a lot quicker than 2.5 days. If the quantum computer isn‚Äôt supreme, it‚Äôs still          extremely impressive because it‚Äôs so small and so efficient. ‚ÄúThey got one little chip in   the quantum computer and the supercomputer is covering a basketball court,‚Äù Preskill       says.&lt;/li&gt;
